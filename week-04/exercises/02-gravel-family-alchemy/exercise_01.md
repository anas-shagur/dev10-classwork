# Install SQLAlchemy

1. Activate your `week-04/exercises` virtual environment.

2. Install the [SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/) package: `pip install SQLAlchemy`.

## Gravel Family

We will use the `gravel_family` schema.

If you removed that schema, re-add it by executing `week-03/exercises/gravel-family-schema-data.sql` in MySQL Workbench.
