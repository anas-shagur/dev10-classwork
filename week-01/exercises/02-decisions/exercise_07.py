# HOMEWORK
# Abdi decides if he should do homework using the following criteria:
# If the day of the week starts with "S" and he has less than 15 hours of homework, he skips homework for the day.
# If the day of the week starts with any other letter or he has more than 15 hours of homework, he does his homework.

value = input("Hours of homework: ")
hours_of_homework = int(value)

day_of_week = input("Day of the week: ")

# 1. Create if/else statements to enforce Abdi's homework rules.
# 2. Print data-rich messages for each scenario.

# Examples
# Hours of homework: 12
# Day of week: Saturday
# I'm taking the day off!
#
# Hours of homework: 2
# Day of week: Thursday
# Time to do the homework...
#
# Hours of homework: 20
# Day of week: Sunday
