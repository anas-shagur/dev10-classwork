value = 24

# 1. Declare a boolean variable in_range.
# 2. When value is between 10 and 20 OR value is between 110 and 120, in_range is true. Otherwise, it's false.
# 3. Build an expression using value to set in_range.
# 4. Print the result.
# 5. Change value to test different cases:
# - less than 10
# - between 10 and 20
# - between 21 and 109
# - between 110 and 120
# - greater than 120
