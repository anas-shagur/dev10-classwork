# 1. Write a loop that uses three values provided by a user to control the loop.
# start - the starting value
# end - controls the loop condition, the loop continues while the value is less than or equal to end
# increment - the number to add after each loop
# Hint: use the `range` function for a `for` loop
# and/or use a `while` loop with a condition that compares the start and end values.
# Print the result.
