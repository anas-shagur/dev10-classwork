# 1. Create a function.
# Name: read_required_string
# Inputs: string
# Output: string
# Description: prompts a user to enter a required string and returns their validated input.
# The parameter is the message displayed to the user.
#
# See the read_required_string implementation in the functions lesson.
# You can definitely improve it. Make sure you don't allow blank input. Checking the len() is not enough.

# Name: print_noun_phrase
# Inputs: none
# Output: none
# Description: prints an adjective + noun phrase to the console based on user input.
