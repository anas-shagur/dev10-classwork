# Stretch Goals

(Not Required)

1. Try a histogram that contains multiple inputs. Our `histfunc` can include: "count", "sum", "avg", "min", "max". We can also use the [color](https://plotly.com/python/histograms/#several-histograms-for-the-different-values-of-one-column) attribute that differentiates between sex, island, and species.

2. Use a treemap that filters down specific values.

3. Use a slider that limits our minimum bound and maximum bound in our scatter plot.

4. Try our hover or click data -- interactive charts.

5. Stretch, stretch goal: use an Antarctica map to count penguins on islands:
