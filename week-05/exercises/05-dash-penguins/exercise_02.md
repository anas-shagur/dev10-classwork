# Simple Charts

1. Create a [scatter plot](https://plotly.com/python/line-and-scatter/). The X-axis is body mass. The Y-axis is bill length.

2. Create a [histogram](https://plotly.com/python/histograms/). The X-axis is species. The Y-axis is unspecified as it just counts our occurrences.

3. Create a [treemap](https://plotly.com/python/treemaps/). The `path` is `["species", "island", "year"]`.
