# Stretch Goals

1. Use a list comprehension to group or "bin" body mass intervals for 250 grams. Calculate the average flipper length. Use a bar chart to represent the bins and averages.

2. Use a stacked bar chart. The X-axis is island. The Y-axis is bill length, bill depth, and flipper length.

3. Use a [nested pie chart](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/pie_and_polar_charts/nested_pie.html) that groups sex and year.
