We present Matplotlib visualizations to data professionals. As data professionals, we want to focus on the technical details: stats, distributions, trends, and analyzing models. A lot of these visualization are one-off. We can noodle around, analyze, and move on to the next thing. If there are consistent and enduring visualizations, we probably want to include it in a dashboard.\n",
